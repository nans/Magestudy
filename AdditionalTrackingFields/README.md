## Magento 2 - Additional fields in the "Shipping and Tracking Information" section
Added new fields (Reference and Contents) to the tracking form.
![Sample](https://github.com/nans/devdocs/blob/master/AdditionalTrackingFields/NewTrackingFields.png "AdditionalTrackingFields screenshot")  
Note: Need to add an event to save data from new fields on "Submit Shipment" button click.
